## Why Scribo exists

German e-invoicing went mandatory for B2B in 2025 (Wachstumschancengesetz, §14 UStG). The EU is rolling out ViDA and Peppol mandates across member states. Most freelancers and micro-SMBs don't know — and the existing tools are either accountant-grade ERP or hand-rolled PDFs that don't validate.

Scribo's bet: if e-invoicing is now infrastructure, it should be free, conversational, and reachable from any AI assistant. So we ship every surface as a separately-indexed public repo, with one hosted backend behind them.
